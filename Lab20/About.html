    <p style="color:black">I am currently enrolled at Grand Circus Detroit’s .NET Bootcamp. My goal is to obtain a position in software development, I have a lifelong passion for computers and technology, since an early age, and continuing through my college years when I obtained a bachelors of Computer Science at Rafidain University College. I love code maintainability and scalability, sound software development practices, and helping teams produce at the highest levels possible.</p>

            Baghdad (/ˈbæɡdæd, bəɡˈdæd/; Arabic: بغداد‎ [baɣˈdaːd] (About this sound listen)) is the capital of Iraq. The population of Baghdad, as of 2016, is approximately 8,765,000,[citation needed][note 1] making it the largest city in Iraq, the second largest city in the Arab world (after Cairo, Egypt), and the second largest city in Western Asia (after Tehran, Iran).

            Located along the Tigris River, the city was founded in the 8th century and became the capital of the Abbasid Caliphate. Within a short time of its inception, Baghdad evolved into a significant cultural, commercial, and intellectual center for the Islamic world. This, in addition to housing several key academic institutions (e.g., House of Wisdom), garnered the city a worldwide reputation as the "Centre of Learning".

            Baghdad was the largest city of the Middle Ages for much of the Abbasid era, peaking at a population of more than a million.[5] The city was largely destroyed at the hands of the Mongol Empire in 1258, resulting in a decline that would linger through many centuries due to frequent plagues and multiple successive empires. With the recognition of Iraq as an independent state (formerly the British Mandate of Mesopotamia) in 1938, Baghdad gradually regained some of its former prominence as a significant center of Arab culture.

            In contemporary times, the city has often faced severe infrastructural damage, most recently due to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and the subsequent Iraq War that lasted until December 2011. In recent years, the city has been frequently subjected to insurgency attacks. The war had resulted in a substantial loss of cultural heritage and historical artifacts as well. As of 2012, Baghdad was listed as one of the least hospitable places in the world to live,[6] and was ranked by Mercer as the worst of 221 major cities as measured by quality-of-life.[7]
