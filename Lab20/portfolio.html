        <P>
            I am currently enrolled at Grand
            Circus Detroit’s .NET Bootcamp. My goal is to obtain a position
            in software development, I have a lifelong passion for computers and
            technology, since an early age, and continuing through my college years when I o
            btained a bachelors of Computer Science at Rafidain University College. I love code m
            aintainability and scalability, sound software development practices, and helping teams
            produce at the highest levels possible.
        </P>
